## A Practical Introduction to Bypassing Application Whitelisting (by @JoeLeonJr)

Students taking this workshop will learn the fundamentals of how application whitelisting works and how to bypass it. This repository contains all of the files needed to conduct the workshop exercises. Video links to the workshop exercise demos are also included below. 

Requirements: a Windows VM or Host that you can turn off Windows Defender + other A/V. 
   - Why do we have to turn A/V off? The purpose of this workshop is to demonstrate how to bypass Application Whitelisting, not A/V.
